# 08 - Triggers in MySQL 

## ðŸ“– Theory: What Are Triggers in MySQL?

A **trigger** is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes (or "fires") when a specific event occurs on a particular table or view in the database. Triggers are used to perform automatic actions in response to events such as **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, or **DELETE** operations on a table.

Triggers help ensure data integrity, enforce business rules, and automate repetitive tasks. They can be set to activate either **before** or **after** the event that modifies the data.

### Types of Triggers:

1. **BEFORE Trigger**: Executes before the actual event occurs (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
2. **AFTER Trigger**: Executes after the event has occurred.
3. **INSTEAD OF Trigger**: Used in views to replace the standard event with a custom operation. It is not supported in MySQL, but is commonly found in other RDBMS systems.

### Syntax to Create a Trigger

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- Trigger logic (SQL statements)
END;
```

* `trigger_name`: The name of the trigger.
* `BEFORE | AFTER`: Specifies when the trigger should fire, either before or after the event.
* `INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE`: Specifies the type of event that will activate the trigger.
* `table_name`: The table on which the trigger will be created.
* `FOR EACH ROW`: Specifies that the trigger will execute for each row affected by the event.

### 1. **Creating a Simple Trigger: BEFORE INSERT**

Triggers can be used to validate or modify data before it is inserted into the table. A common use case is to automatically fill in fields such as timestamps or user information.

#### Example: BEFORE INSERT Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_customer
BEFORE INSERT ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.created_at = NOW();
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: This trigger automatically sets the `created_at` field of a new customer to the current timestamp (`NOW()`) before the row is inserted into the `customers` table.

#### Example: Inserting Data That Fires the Trigger

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (customer_name) VALUES ('John Doe');
```

* **Result**: The trigger will automatically insert the current date and time into the `created_at` field of the `customers` table.

---

### 2. **Creating a Trigger: AFTER UPDATE**

An **AFTER UPDATE** trigger is used when you want to perform some action after a record has been updated. For instance, you might want to log changes to sensitive data or track modifications to key fields.

#### Example: AFTER UPDATE Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER after_update_customer
AFTER UPDATE ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO customer_audit_log (customer_id, old_name, new_name, change_date)
    VALUES (OLD.customer_id, OLD.customer_name, NEW.customer_name, NOW());
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: This trigger inserts a record into the `customer_audit_log` table every time a customer's name is updated. It logs the `customer_id`, the old name (`OLD.customer_name`), the new name (`NEW.customer_name`), and the timestamp of the update.

#### Example: Updating Data That Fires the Trigger

```sql
UPDATE customers SET customer_name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

* **Result**: The trigger will log the change in the `customer_audit_log` table, recording both the old and new names along with the timestamp.

---

### 3. **Creating a Trigger: AFTER DELETE**

An **AFTER DELETE** trigger can be used to perform actions after a row has been deleted. For example, you may want to delete corresponding records in related tables or log deletions.

#### Example: AFTER DELETE Trigger

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER after_delete_customer
AFTER DELETE ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO deleted_customers (customer_id, customer_name, deleted_at)
    VALUES (OLD.customer_id, OLD.customer_name, NOW());
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: This trigger inserts the deleted customer information into a `deleted_customers` table whenever a row is deleted from the `customers` table. The `OLD` keyword is used to reference the values before the deletion.

#### Example: Deleting Data That Fires the Trigger

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

* **Result**: The trigger will insert the deleted customer's details into the `deleted_customers` table with the deletion timestamp.

---

### 4. **Managing Triggers**

Triggers are managed through the `CREATE`, `SHOW`, and `DROP` statements. You can list existing triggers or delete them as needed.

#### Example: Show Existing Triggers

```sql
SHOW TRIGGERS;
```

* **Explanation**: This command shows a list of all triggers in the current database.

#### Example: Dropping a Trigger

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS after_delete_customer;
```

* **Explanation**: This command removes the `after_delete_customer` trigger if it exists.

---

### Use Cases of Triggers

1. **Audit Logging**: Triggers are frequently used to track changes in data for auditing purposes. For example, tracking updates, inserts, or deletions to sensitive customer or transaction data.

   * **Example**: An `AFTER UPDATE` trigger could log the changes made to a customer's contact information, capturing both old and new values.

2. **Data Validation**: Before inserting or updating records, triggers can be used to validate data, ensuring it meets specific requirements. For instance, enforcing constraints such as making sure an email address is unique or that a value falls within a specific range.

   * **Example**: A `BEFORE INSERT` trigger can check if an email address is already in use before inserting a new customer record.

3. **Data Synchronization**: In scenarios where multiple tables or systems must stay in sync, triggers can be used to automatically update related data.

   * **Example**: A `AFTER UPDATE` trigger could automatically update the stock quantity in a related inventory table whenever a sales order is modified.

4. **Preventing Invalid Operations**: Triggers can be set to prevent certain operations from occurring, thus enforcing business rules.

   * **Example**: A `BEFORE DELETE` trigger could prevent the deletion of a customer if there are related active orders, ensuring that data integrity is maintained.

## âš¡ When to Use Triggers?

* **Data Integrity**: Triggers help ensure that business rules and constraints are respected when modifying data.
* **Auditing and Logging**: If you need to keep a record of changes made to your data, triggers provide a way to log operations like insertions, updates, and deletions.
* **Automated Actions**: Triggers are useful for automating tasks like sending notifications or updating related records when changes occur in the database.

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

Triggers in MySQL are powerful tools for automating tasks and ensuring the integrity of your data. They allow you to define automatic actions that happen in response to data changes, helping enforce business rules and maintain consistency in your database. By using triggers, you can automate processes like data validation, auditing, and synchronization, making your system more robust and efficient.
