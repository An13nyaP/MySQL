# 09 - Transactions in MySQL

## ðŸ“– Theory: What Are Transactions in MySQL?

A **transaction** in MySQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit. Transactions allow you to group multiple SQL operations together so they are executed as a whole. If all operations in the transaction succeed, the changes are committed to the database. If any operation fails, the changes are rolled back, ensuring that the database remains consistent.

### ACID Properties

Transactions are governed by the ACID properties, which ensure the reliability and integrity of the database. ACID stands for:

1. **Atomicity**: A transaction is atomic, meaning it is treated as a single unit. If one part of the transaction fails, the whole transaction is rolled back, and no partial changes are saved.
2. **Consistency**: A transaction ensures that the database transitions from one consistent state to another. It preserves the integrity of the data.
3. **Isolation**: Each transaction is isolated from others. Even if multiple transactions are happening at the same time, each transaction will not be affected by others until it is completed.
4. **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures.

### Transaction Commands

1. **START TRANSACTION / BEGIN**: Starts a new transaction.
2. **COMMIT**: Commits the current transaction, making all changes permanent.
3. **ROLLBACK**: Rolls back the current transaction, undoing all changes made during the transaction.
4. **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can roll back later.

### Syntax for Using Transactions

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- SQL Statements

COMMIT;  -- Save changes if everything goes well
-- OR
ROLLBACK;  -- Revert changes if something goes wrong
```

### Example: Simple Transaction

#### Scenario: Transferring Funds Between Two Bank Accounts

Letâ€™s consider a scenario where we are transferring funds between two accounts. The transaction will consist of two steps:

1. Deducting the amount from Account A.
2. Adding the same amount to Account B.

Both steps need to succeed or fail together to maintain consistency.

#### 1. Start a Transaction

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

#### 2. Deduct Amount from Account A

```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
```

#### 3. Add Amount to Account B

```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
```

#### 4. Commit the Transaction

```sql
COMMIT;
```

#### Example: Rolling Back a Transaction

If, for any reason, the second operation (adding funds to Account B) fails, we need to roll back the entire transaction to maintain data consistency. For example, if there is a constraint violation or an error during the second operation:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct amount from Account A
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Simulate an error: Account B does not exist
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 3;

-- Rollback the entire transaction due to error
ROLLBACK;
```

In this case, since the update on Account B failed, the transaction is rolled back, and the deduction from Account A is also reverted.

---

### Example: Using SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK to a SAVEPOINT

A **SAVEPOINT** allows you to set a point in the transaction to which you can roll back if needed. Itâ€™s useful when you want to roll back part of the transaction without affecting the entire transaction.

#### Scenario: Trying Multiple Operations and Rolling Back Only Part of Them

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct amount from Account A
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Set a savepoint after deducting from Account A
SAVEPOINT DeductedFromAccountA;

-- Try to add funds to Account B
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Simulate an error (e.g., insufficient funds in Account A)
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Roll back to the savepoint if there's an error
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT DeductedFromAccountA;

-- Commit the successful transaction
COMMIT;
```

#### **Explanation**:

* The transaction deducts 500 from Account A, then tries to add the same amount to Account B.
* When it tries to deduct 1000 from Account A (which is invalid), it rolls back to the savepoint, undoing only the invalid operation, while leaving the deduction from Account A intact.
* Finally, it commits the valid operations.

### Using Transactions with SELECT Statements

Transactions are not limited to only `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations. You can also use them in combination with `SELECT` statements to ensure that your reads are consistent during the transaction.

#### Example: Transaction with SELECT for Consistent Read

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Lock rows for update
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

COMMIT;
```

In this example, the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` statement locks the selected rows for the duration of the transaction, ensuring that no other transaction can modify the rows until the current transaction is completed.

### Real-Life Use Cases of Transactions

1. **Banking Transactions**: When transferring money between accounts, you need to ensure that both the debit and credit actions occur together. A transaction ensures that either both operations succeed or neither does, preventing inconsistencies such as deducting funds without adding them to the recipient's account.

   * **Example**: A bank transfer involves two updates: deducting money from one account and adding it to another. If either fails, the entire operation should be rolled back.

2. **Inventory Management**: When adding or removing items from an inventory, a transaction ensures that inventory counts are updated atomically. If one update fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to avoid discrepancies.

   * **Example**: When processing an order, the quantity of items ordered is deducted from the inventory. If any part of the process fails, the system must roll back all updates to maintain the correct inventory count.

3. **Order Processing**: In e-commerce platforms, order creation involves updating multiple tables: orders, payments, and shipping. If an issue occurs during any part of the process, the transaction ensures that no partial orders are created.

   * **Example**: When a customer places an order, you might need to update the `orders`, `payments`, and `shipping` tables. If any of these updates fail, the whole order is rolled back.

### ðŸ›  Query Examples for Transactions

### Query 1: Start a Transaction

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

### Query 2: Perform Operations in a Transaction

```sql
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
```

### Query 3: Commit the Transaction

```sql
COMMIT;
```

### Query 4: Rollback the Transaction

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### Query 5: Set a Savepoint

```sql
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

### Query 6: Rollback to a Savepoint

```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

## âš¡ When to Use Transactions?

* **Atomic Operations**: Whenever you need to ensure that a series of operations are treated as a single unit (e.g., transferring funds, processing orders).
* **Data Integrity**: When operations depend on each other, and you must prevent partial updates from leaving your database in an inconsistent state.
* **Error Handling**: Use transactions to handle failures gracefully and revert all changes when an error occurs.
* **Concurrency Control**: Transactions help manage concurrency, ensuring that multiple users can work with the database without conflicting changes.

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

Transactions in MySQL are essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that your database operates in a consistent manner. By grouping multiple SQL operations into a single unit, you can prevent partial updates and ensure that your data remains accurate and reliable, even in the face of errors. Using transactions effectively allows you to create robust, error-resistant applications that can handle complex operations reliably.
