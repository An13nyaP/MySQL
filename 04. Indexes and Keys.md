## ðŸ“– Theory: What Are Indexes & Keys?

Indexes in MySQL are special data structures used to speed up data retrieval operations. They are similar to the index in a book: they allow MySQL to quickly find the data it needs, instead of scanning the entire table.

### Key Concepts of Indexes:

1. **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record.
2. **Unique Key**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
3. **Index**: Improves the speed of lookups by creating a map for fast access.
4. **Full-Text Index**: Optimized for searching text-based data.
5. **Composite Index**: Index on multiple columns.

Now, let's dive into how MySQL handles these indexes internally.

### How Indexes Work Internally in MySQL:

MySQL uses various types of indexing mechanisms, with the most common being **B-tree indexes**. Letâ€™s understand this with some technical details:

1. **B-tree Index**:

   * MySQLâ€™s default index type is **B-tree** (Balanced Tree). It stores data in a sorted tree structure where each node is connected to others in a balanced way.
   * The data is split into **nodes**, and each node contains a **key** and a **pointer** to the corresponding row in the table.
   * B-trees allow for fast retrieval by narrowing down search space. The time complexity of searching, inserting, and deleting is logarithmic (O(log n)), making it highly efficient.

2. **Hash Index**:

   * Hash indexes use hash tables to store data, providing constant time complexity (O(1)) for lookups. However, they're only useful for equality comparisons (i.e., `=`), not for range queries (i.e., `>`, `<`).
   * This type is mainly used in **Memory tables**.

3. **Full-Text Index**:

   * Full-text indexes are specialized for text searching. They allow MySQL to break the text into individual words and create an index to facilitate fast searches.

4. **Spatial Index**:

   * This type of index is used in MySQLâ€™s **Spatial Data Types** (for geographic coordinates, for example). It uses **R-trees** to index geometric data for fast range queries.

### 1. **Primary Key**

A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies a record in a table. By default, MySQL automatically creates a **B-tree index** on the primary key column(s).

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

* **Theory**: The `id` column is the **Primary Key**, and MySQL creates a **B-tree index** on it. This ensures that each row is uniquely identifiable.
* **Purpose**: The index is used for fast lookups of specific rows based on `id`, such as `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 3`.

**Internal Mechanism**: MySQL stores the **primary key** as a **clustered index** (this means the actual data rows are stored in the order of the primary key).

---

### 2. **Unique Key**

A **Unique Key** enforces the uniqueness of values in a column but allows `NULL` values. Like primary keys, unique keys also create a **B-tree index**.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

* **Theory**: The `username` column has a **Unique Key** constraint. This guarantees that no two users can have the same username. MySQL creates a **B-tree index** to enforce this.
* **Purpose**: Helps speed up lookups for `username` and ensures no duplicates.

**Internal Mechanism**: Like the primary key, a **B-tree index** is used, but itâ€™s not clustered. The **unique constraint** ensures that there are no duplicate values.

---

### 3. **Index**

An **Index** helps speed up data retrieval. MySQL uses a **B-tree index** by default for regular indexes unless you specify otherwise (e.g., for full-text search).

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_first_name ON employees (first_name);
```

* **Theory**: The index `idx_first_name` is created on the `first_name` column, which makes searches based on first names much faster.
* **Purpose**: If we frequently query by `first_name`, this index will allow the query to execute much faster than performing a full table scan.

**Internal Mechanism**: MySQL creates a **B-tree index**. The **B-tree structure** allows for fast lookup of `first_name` values.

---

### 4. **Full-Text Index**

A **Full-Text Index** is used for fast searching in large text fields, such as articles, descriptions, or content.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    content TEXT,
    FULLTEXT(title, content)
);
```

* **Theory**: The `FULLTEXT` index on `title` and `content` allows for fast text searches. MySQL uses a special **inverted index** for text searching, which is more efficient than using a B-tree for textual data.
* **Purpose**: Allows you to quickly search for articles containing specific keywords.

**Internal Mechanism**: MySQL stores the words in the text columns in an **inverted index**, which maps words to rows, rather than mapping rows to words as in the case of a **B-tree index**.

### 5. **Composite Index**

A **Composite Index** is an index on multiple columns. This is useful when queries involve filtering or sorting based on multiple columns.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_age ON employees (first_name, age);
```

* **Theory**: The index `idx_name_age` is a **composite index** on both `first_name` and `age`. It helps speed up queries that filter or sort by both `first_name` and `age` together.
* **Purpose**: If you often run queries like `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John' AND age = 30`, this index helps by narrowing down the search space.

**Internal Mechanism**: The **B-tree index** is created on both `first_name` and `age`. MySQL organizes the index in such a way that it first sorts by `first_name`, then by `age` within each `first_name`.

## ðŸ›  Query Performance and Monitoring

To see how indexes affect query performance, you can use the `EXPLAIN` command, which provides information on how MySQL executes a query and whether it uses an index.

#### Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

* **Explanation**:

  * **`key`**: The index used for the query, such as `idx_first_name`.
  * **`rows`**: The number of rows MySQL needs to scan.
  * **`Extra`**: Additional info, like "Using index" which means MySQL used the index without scanning the table data.

## âš¡ When to Use Indexes?

* **Frequent Lookups**: Use indexes when your queries often filter or sort by specific columns.
* **Join Operations**: Use indexes on columns that are used in join conditions.
* **Read-heavy Databases**: Indexes are especially beneficial for databases with a lot of `SELECT` operations, as they can significantly reduce query time.
* **Text Searches**: Use **Full-Text Indexes** for searching in large text columns.

---

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

* **Primary Keys** and **Unique Keys** enforce data integrity while also improving query speed.
* **Indexes** (primarily **B-trees**) are used to speed up data retrieval for frequently queried columns.
* **Composite Indexes** speed up multi-column queries, while **Full-Text Indexes** enhance text search performance.
* Use the `EXPLAIN` command to monitor how indexes impact your queries.

By using indexes effectively, you can design highly performant databases that can scale well with large datasets, while keeping your data retrieval times quick.
