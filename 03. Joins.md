# 📘 03 Mastering SQL JOINs

SQL JOINs let you combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns. This is essential for relational databases and powers real-world apps like HR dashboards, e-commerce systems, and student info portals.

## 📌 Topics Covered

1. **INNER JOIN**
2. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**
3. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL workaround)**
5. **CROSS JOIN**
6. **Self JOIN**

Each section includes examples, real-world use cases, and practical solutions.

## 1️⃣ INNER JOIN

**Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

Get a list of employees and their department names.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### ✅ Output:

| name  | department |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Alice | HR         |
| Bob   | Sales      |

---

## 2️⃣ LEFT JOIN

**Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table. Nulls where no match.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

List all employees, including those not assigned to any department.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### ✅ Output:

| name  | department |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Alice | HR         |
| Tom   | NULL       |

---

## 3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN

**Opposite of LEFT JOIN: All rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

List all departments, even if they have no employees assigned.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT d.name AS department, e.name AS employee
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### ✅ Output:

| department | employee |
| ---------- | -------- |
| HR         | Alice    |
| Support    | NULL     |

---

## 4️⃣ FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL Workaround)

**MySQL doesn’t support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. Use UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOIN.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

Get all employees and departments, even if one has no match in the other.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee, d.name AS department
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id

UNION

SELECT e.name AS employee, d.name AS department
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

### ✅ Output:

| employee | department |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Alice    | HR         |
| NULL     | Support    |
| Tom      | NULL       |

---

## 5️⃣ CROSS JOIN

**Returns the Cartesian product – all combinations of rows.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

Create a matrix of every product with every location for inventory planning.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT p.name AS product, l.name AS location
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN locations l;
```

### ✅ Output:

| product | location |
| ------- | -------- |
| Pen     | Delhi    |
| Pen     | Mumbai   |
| Pencil  | Delhi    |

---

## 6️⃣ SELF JOIN

**Joining a table to itself. Useful for hierarchy or comparisons.**

### 🎯 Use Case:

List employees and their managers.

### 🧪 Example:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

### ✅ Output:

| employee | manager |
| -------- | ------- |
| Alice    | Bob     |
| Bob      | NULL    |

---

## ✅ Summary

* Use JOINs to relate data across tables.
* INNER JOIN = only matches
* LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN = keep all from one side
* FULL OUTER = UNION of both sides (in MySQL)
* CROSS JOIN = every combo
* SELF JOIN = for hierarchy within the same table
