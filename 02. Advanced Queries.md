3. **CASE Statements (Conditional Logic)**
4. **Advanced Filtering Techniques**
5. **Aliasing and Derived Tables**

## 1️⃣ Subqueries (Nested SELECTs)

A subquery is a query inside another SQL query. It helps you perform operations in multiple steps logically.

```sql
-- Find employees who earn more than the average salary
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees
);
```

📌 *Use Case:* Filter based on dynamic conditions like averages, counts, or data from related tables.

## 2️⃣ IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS

### 🔹 `IN`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (1, 3, 5);
```

### 🔹 `ANY` & `ALL`

```sql
-- Find employees with salary higher than any sales employee
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (
    SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
);
```

```sql
-- Higher than all
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Support'
);
```

### 🔹 `EXISTS`

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.id = e.department_id AND d.name = 'Engineering'
);
```

📌 *Use Case:* Great for conditional presence checks, comparisons, and logical filtering.

---

## 3️⃣ CASE Statements (If-Else Logic)

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary >= 80000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS salary_level
FROM employees;
```

📌 *Use Case:* Adds conditional labels or performs dynamic logic inside queries.

---

## 4️⃣ Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 🔹 BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000;
```

### 🔹 LIKE

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%'; -- names starting with A
```

### 🔹 REGEXP (for pattern matching)

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE name REGEXP '^A.*n$'; -- starts with A and ends with n
```

---

## 5️⃣ Aliasing and Derived Tables

```sql
-- Using derived tables with aliases
SELECT d.department_name, avg_dept_salary.avg_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS avg_dept_salary
ON d.id = avg_dept_salary.department_id;
```

📌 *Use Case:* Helps break complex queries into manageable, readable parts using sub-results.

## ✅ Summary

Advanced queries help you:

* Build logical conditions and reusable structures
* Filter data dynamically
* Handle complex reporting needs

📚 Master these, and you're well on your way to writing pro-level SQL!
