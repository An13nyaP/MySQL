# 01. MySQL Basics - Refresher

## 1. Basic SQL Operations

### 1.1 SELECT

**Use:** Retrieve data from a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Selects all columns
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;  -- Selects specific columns
```

### 1.2 INSERT

**Use:** Add new records to a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department, salary)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000);
```

### 1.3 UPDATE

**Use:** Modify existing records.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 55000
WHERE employee_id = 3;
```

### 1.4 DELETE

**Use:** Remove records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 5;
```

## 2. Filtering and Sorting

### 2.1 WHERE

**Use:** Filter rows based on condition.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### 2.2 ORDER BY

**Use:** Sort results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;  -- Highest salary first
```

### 2.3 LIMIT

**Use:** Restrict the number of rows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5;  -- Show only top 5 records
```

## 3. Aggregate Functions

### 3.1 COUNT()

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;  -- Total number of employees
```

### 3.2 SUM()

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;  -- Total salary payout
```

### 3.3 AVG()

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;  -- Average salary
```

### 3.4 MIN() and MAX()

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(salary) FROM employees;  -- Lowest and highest salaries
```

---

## 4. GROUP BY and HAVING

### 4.1 GROUP BY

**Use:** Group rows and apply aggregation.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### 4.2 HAVING

**Use:** Filter groups (like WHERE but for groups).

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING avg_salary > 50000;
```

---

## 5. Simple JOINs

Assume two tables:

* `employees(employee_id, first_name, department_id)`
* `departments(department_id, department_name)`

### 5.1 INNER JOIN

**Use:** Match rows that exist in both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 5.2 LEFT JOIN

**Use:** Include all rows from left table, even if no match.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 5.3 RIGHT JOIN

**Use:** Include all rows from right table, even if no match.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
