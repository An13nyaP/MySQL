# 05 - Normalization in MySQL

## ðŸ“– Theory: What Is Database Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down a large table into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them, ensuring data is logically stored.

### Objectives of Normalization:

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Redundant data (repeated information) is minimized, which improves storage efficiency.
2. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Properly structured tables ensure consistency and correctness of data.
3. **Make Updates Easier**: Easier to insert, update, and delete data due to fewer dependencies.

### Forms of Normalization:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that there are no repeating groups and each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Meets the criteria of 1NF and eliminates partial dependencies, meaning that non-key columns depend on the entire primary key.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Meets the criteria of 2NF and eliminates transitive dependencies, meaning non-key columns depend only on the primary key and not on other non-key columns.
4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: An advanced version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.
5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: Deals with multi-valued dependencies.
6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**: Eliminates redundancy due to join dependencies.

### 1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **1NF** if it meets the following criteria:

* All columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.
* Each record (row) is unique.

#### Example of Not in 1NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    products VARCHAR(255)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `products` column stores multiple products in a single field, violating 1NF because it contains non-atomic values.

#### Example of 1NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    product_name VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_name, product_name) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'Laptop'),
(1, 'John Doe', 'Mouse'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'Keyboard');
```

* **Explanation**: The `products` column is split into individual records, and now the table is in 1NF because each column contains atomic values.

---

### 2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **2NF** if:

* It is in **1NF**.
* There are no **partial dependencies**, meaning non-key columns depend on the entire primary key.

#### Example of Not in 2NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `product_name` depends only on `product_id`, not on the entire primary key (`order_id`, `product_id`). This is a partial dependency.

#### Example of 2NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `product_name` is moved to a separate `products` table, eliminating partial dependency. Now, the tables are in 2NF.

---

### 3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **3NF** if:

* It is in **2NF**.
* There are no **transitive dependencies**, meaning non-key columns depend only on the primary key and not on other non-key columns.

#### Example of Not in 3NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `department_name` depends on `department_id`, which is a non-key column, creating a transitive dependency (`employee_id` â†’ `department_id` â†’ `department_name`).

#### Example of 3NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `department_name` is moved to a separate `departments` table, eliminating the transitive dependency. Now, the tables are in 3NF.

---

### 4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **BCNF** if:

* It is in **3NF**.
* Every determinant is a candidate key, meaning that all non-trivial functional dependencies have the left side as a candidate key.

#### Example of Not in BCNF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    instructor_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: Here, `instructor_name` is dependent on `course_id` (not a candidate key), which violates BCNF.

#### Example of BCNF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT,
    instructor_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (course_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The `instructor_name` is moved to a separate `courses` table, ensuring that every determinant is a candidate key.

---

### 5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **4NF** if:

* It is in **BCNF**.
* It has no **multi-valued dependencies**, meaning that one attribute depends on another in a way that it can take multiple values.

#### Example of Not in 4NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    instructor_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_name)
);
```

* **Explanation**: A student can have multiple courses and instructors, so the table has a multi-valued dependency.

#### Example of 4NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_name)
);

CREATE TABLE student_instructors (
    student_id INT,
    instructor_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, instructor_name)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The multi-valued dependency is eliminated by splitting the table into two: one for courses and one for instructors.

---

### 6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**

#### Definition:

A table is in **5NF** if:

* It is in **4NF**.
* It has no **join dependencies**, meaning that all information in the table can be reconstructed from smaller tables.

#### Example of Not in 5NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    supplier_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id, supplier_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The table might contain redundant data if, for example, a product can be supplied by multiple suppliers and may appear in multiple orders.

#### Example of 5NF:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_products (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_suppliers (
    product_id INT,
    supplier_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, supplier_id)
);
```

* **Explanation**: The table is split into three smaller tables, eliminating redundancy and ensuring that all data can be reconstructed by joining the tables.

## ðŸ›  Query Examples for Normalization

### Query 1: To create a table in 1NF

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);
```

### Query 2: To normalize to 2NF (splitting partial dependencies)

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
```

### Query 3: To normalize to 3NF (removing transitive dependencies)

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    department_name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
);
```

## âš¡ When to Use Normalization?

* **Small to Medium-sized Databases**: Normalization helps organize data and reduces redundancy.
* **Transactional Systems**: Normalized databases maintain consistency and integrity.
* **When Updates and Deletions Are Frequent**: Normalization simplifies and ensures correct updates or deletions.

---

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

* **Normalization** ensures that data is logically stored, reduces redundancy, and maintains integrity.
* **1NF** focuses on atomic data, **2NF** addresses partial dependencies, and **3NF** tackles transitive dependencies.
* Higher normal forms like **BCNF**, **4NF**, and **5NF** handle more complex dependencies.

By following normalization practices, you can design databases that are efficient, scalable, and maintainable in the long term.
