# 06 - Views in MySQL

## ðŸ“– Theory: What Are Views in MySQL?

A **view** is a virtual table in MySQL, created by a **SELECT** query that pulls data from one or more tables. Unlike actual tables, views do not store data; they only display the data from the underlying tables. Views allow users to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and present data in a way thatâ€™s easier to access.

### Benefits of Using Views:

1. **Simplified Queries**: Complex joins or calculations can be encapsulated in a view, making it easier to retrieve results.
2. **Security**: You can restrict access to specific data by granting access to a view rather than a table.
3. **Data Abstraction**: Views provide an abstract layer, which means the user doesnâ€™t need to understand the underlying table structure.
4. **Reusability**: Views can be reused in multiple queries, reducing repetition and ensuring consistency.

### Types of Views:

1. **Simple View**: A view created from a single table and contains no functions or aggregations.
2. **Complex View**: A view created from multiple tables, involving joins, aggregations, or functions.
3. **Updatable View**: A view that allows users to insert, update, and delete data (provided the underlying query allows it).
4. **Materialized View**: A view that stores its results physically. MySQL does not support materialized views directly, but they can be simulated using temporary tables or other strategies.

### 1. **Creating a View**

A view is created using the `CREATE VIEW` statement. You define the name of the view and the SELECT query that will populate it.

#### Example 1: Creating a Simple View

```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

* **Explanation**: This creates a view called `customer_orders`, which combines data from the `customers` and `orders` tables. You can now query `customer_orders` like a regular table.

#### Example 2: Creating a Complex View with Aggregation

```sql
CREATE VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS total_sales, SUM(order_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id;
```

* **Explanation**: This creates a view that summarizes product sales by counting the number of orders and calculating the total revenue for each product. This is a more complex view involving aggregation.

---

### 2. **Querying a View**

Once a view is created, you can query it just like a regular table.

#### Example 1: Simple Query on a View

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_orders;
```

* **Explanation**: This retrieves all records from the `customer_orders` view, showing customer names, their order IDs, and order dates.

#### Example 2: Querying with a WHERE Clause

```sql
SELECT customer_name, order_id, order_date
FROM customer_orders
WHERE customer_name = 'John Doe';
```

* **Explanation**: This filters the `customer_orders` view to show orders placed by "John Doe".

---

### 3. **Updating a View**

Some views are updatable, meaning you can insert, update, or delete records in the underlying table(s) through the view. However, certain conditions must be met, such as no aggregation, no joins, and no use of DISTINCT in the view definition.

#### Example 1: Inserting Data into a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, department_id
FROM employees;

INSERT INTO employee_view (employee_id, employee_name, department_id)
VALUES (101, 'Alice Johnson', 3);
```

* **Explanation**: The `employee_view` allows you to insert new employee records into the `employees` table. The view makes it easier to work with only the necessary columns.

#### Example 2: Updating Data Through a View

```sql
UPDATE employee_view
SET department_id = 4
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

* **Explanation**: This updates the department for the employee with `employee_id` 101 through the `employee_view`.

#### Example 3: Deleting Data Through a View

```sql
DELETE FROM employee_view
WHERE employee_id = 101;
```

* **Explanation**: This deletes the employee with `employee_id` 101 from the `employees` table using the `employee_view`.

---

### 4. **Dropping a View**

If a view is no longer needed, it can be removed using the `DROP VIEW` statement.

#### Example:

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_orders;
```

* **Explanation**: This removes the `customer_orders` view from the database.

---

### 5. **Use Cases of Views**

1. **Simplifying Complex Queries**: Views are ideal for encapsulating complex queries, such as those involving joins or aggregations, so that the same query does not need to be repeated across multiple parts of an application.

   * **Example**: If you frequently need to get customer details along with their order information, a view like `customer_orders` simplifies this operation without needing to repeatedly write complex joins.

2. **Data Security**: You may have sensitive data in a table (like salary or personal information), and you want to allow access only to certain columns. You can create a view that only exposes the necessary columns.

   * **Example**: If you have an `employees` table with salary data, you can create a view that hides the salary column from users who donâ€™t need it.

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW public_employee_info AS
   SELECT employee_id, employee_name, department_id
   FROM employees;
   ```

3. **Data Abstraction**: You can abstract the underlying schema, so users donâ€™t need to know how data is stored or structured.

   * **Example**: If the database schema changes (e.g., if a table structure is altered), you can modify the view instead of changing the queries in multiple applications.

4. **Aggregating Data**: Views can simplify access to aggregated data, such as total sales, average order amounts, etc., without requiring recalculation each time.

   * **Example**: The `product_sales_summary` view gives a quick overview of product sales without having to re-run the aggregation query every time.

## ðŸ›  Query Examples for Views

### Query 1: Creating a Simple View with Join

```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS
SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

### Query 2: Creating a Complex View with Aggregation

```sql
CREATE VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS total_sales, SUM(order_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id;
```

### Query 3: Selecting Data from a View

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer_orders;
```

### Query 4: Filtering Data in a View

```sql
SELECT customer_name, order_id, order_date
FROM customer_orders
WHERE customer_name = 'John Doe';
```

### Query 5: Dropping a View

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_orders;
```

## âš¡ When to Use Views?

* **Complex Queries**: When queries involving multiple joins or aggregations are repeated, a view can make them reusable and easier to manage.
* **Security**: When you want to restrict access to certain data in the table, views can help expose only the necessary information.
* **Data Abstraction**: When you need to present data in a simplified way without showing the underlying schema or tables.
* **Performance**: Although views can make queries easier, keep in mind that complex views (especially those involving joins or subqueries) can impact performance if not optimized.

---

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

* **Views** are powerful tools for simplifying complex queries, securing sensitive data, and abstracting database design.
* They allow for **reusability** and make code cleaner by encapsulating frequently used queries.
* Although views do not store data themselves, they can significantly improve performance and maintainability, especially when used correctly.

Views are an essential concept in MySQL that can make working with databases more efficient and user-friendly while ensuring security and data consistency.
