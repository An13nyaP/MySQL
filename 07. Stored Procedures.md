# 07 - Stored Procedures in MySQL (Theory + Examples)

## ðŸ“– Theory: What Are Stored Procedures in MySQL?

A **stored procedure** is a set of SQL statements that can be executed on the MySQL server. Unlike normal queries, a stored procedure is a precompiled group of queries stored in the database. Stored procedures help encapsulate logic in the database, improve performance, and provide security.

### Advantages of Using Stored Procedures:

1. **Reusability**: You can call stored procedures multiple times without re-writing the same SQL code.
2. **Performance**: Stored procedures are compiled and stored in the database, so they can execute more efficiently compared to executing individual queries.
3. **Security**: You can control access to data by granting permissions to execute stored procedures rather than giving direct access to tables.
4. **Maintainability**: The logic is centralized in the stored procedure, making the system easier to maintain.
5. **Error Handling**: MySQL stored procedures provide better error handling using the `DECLARE`, `HANDLER`, and `SIGNAL` keywords.

### Creating a Stored Procedure

To create a stored procedure, we use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement. It allows you to define the name of the procedure and the SQL logic that should be executed when the procedure is called.

#### Syntax:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name ([parameters])
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

---

### 1. **Creating a Simple Stored Procedure**

This example demonstrates creating a stored procedure that selects data from a table.

#### Example: Simple Stored Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_customers()
BEGIN
    SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: The `get_customers` procedure retrieves the `customer_id` and `customer_name` from the `customers` table. The `DELIMITER` command changes the default delimiter from `;` to `//` so that MySQL can differentiate between the end of the procedure and individual SQL statements.

---

### 2. **Calling a Stored Procedure**

To call a stored procedure, we use the `CALL` statement followed by the procedure name and any required parameters.

#### Example: Calling the Stored Procedure

```sql
CALL get_customers();
```

* **Explanation**: This calls the `get_customers` procedure, which returns the list of customers.

---

### 3. **Stored Procedures with Parameters**

Stored procedures can accept input and output parameters. Input parameters allow you to pass values into the procedure, while output parameters can be used to return results.

#### Example: Stored Procedure with Input Parameters

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_by_id(IN customer_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: The `get_customer_by_id` procedure accepts an input parameter `customer_id` and uses it to filter the `customers` table. The result is the `customer_name` for the given `customer_id`.

#### Example: Calling a Stored Procedure with Input Parameter

```sql
CALL get_customer_by_id(3);
```

* **Explanation**: This calls the `get_customer_by_id` procedure and retrieves the `customer_name` for the customer with `customer_id` 3.

#### Example: Stored Procedure with Output Parameters

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_order_count_by_customer(IN customer_id INT, OUT order_count INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO order_count FROM orders WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: This stored procedure takes an input parameter `customer_id` and outputs the total number of orders (`order_count`) for that customer.

#### Example: Calling a Stored Procedure with Output Parameter

```sql
CALL get_order_count_by_customer(3, @order_count);
SELECT @order_count;
```

* **Explanation**: This calls the `get_order_count_by_customer` procedure for `customer_id` 3 and stores the result in the `@order_count` variable. We then retrieve the value using a `SELECT` statement.

---

### 4. **Error Handling in Stored Procedures**

Stored procedures provide robust error handling. You can use the `DECLARE` statement to define a handler for different types of errors.

#### Example: Error Handling with DECLARE HANDLER

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_by_id(IN customer_id INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        SELECT 'An error occurred' AS error_message;
    END;

    SELECT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

* **Explanation**: This procedure handles errors that may occur while selecting the customer by `customer_id`. If an error occurs, the procedure will return an error message instead of failing.

---

### 5. **Dropping a Stored Procedure**

If a stored procedure is no longer needed, you can remove it using the `DROP PROCEDURE` statement.

#### Example:

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS get_customers;
```

* **Explanation**: This statement removes the `get_customers` procedure if it exists in the database.

---

### Use Cases of Stored Procedures

1. **Data Validation**: You can use stored procedures to validate and process data before inserting it into a table.

   * **Example**: If you're inserting records into an `employees` table, you could use a stored procedure to check if the employee ID already exists before performing the insert.

2. **Business Logic Encapsulation**: If certain business logic needs to be applied to data, you can encapsulate it in a stored procedure, ensuring itâ€™s applied uniformly across all database operations.

   * **Example**: A stored procedure could calculate and update an employeeâ€™s salary based on certain criteria, like performance, bonuses, and company policies.

3. **Reporting**: Stored procedures are commonly used to generate reports based on complex queries involving joins, filters, and aggregations.

   * **Example**: A stored procedure could aggregate sales data by month and product category for a reporting dashboard.

4. **Batch Processing**: Stored procedures can be used for batch processing tasks like updating records in bulk, sending notifications, or running scheduled maintenance tasks.

   * **Example**: A stored procedure could be used to batch-update the status of orders that have passed the shipping date.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE get_customers()
BEGIN
    SELECT customer_id, customer_name FROM customers;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Query 2: Creating a Stored Procedure with Parameters

```sql

CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_by_id(IN customer_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Query 3: Calling a Stored Procedure with Input Parameter

### Query 6: Dropping a Stored Procedure

```sql

## âš¡ When to Use Stored Procedures?

* **Complex Business Logic**: When you have complex calculations or business rules that need to be applied to data.
* **Performance**: If you need to run multiple queries in a single call to the database, stored procedures help reduce the overhead.
* **Security**: When you want to restrict direct access to underlying tables and only allow users to interact with data via pre-defined logic.
* **Data Integrity**: When you want to ensure that all data manipulations follow specific rules and patterns consistently.

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

Stored procedures are powerful tools for encapsulating SQL logic in MySQL. They offer reusability, better performance, security, and centralized management of business logic. With the ability to accept parameters, handle errors, and encapsulate complex queries, stored procedures are essential in creating efficient, maintainable, and secure database-driven applications.
